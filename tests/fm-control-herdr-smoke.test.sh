# tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh - real-herdr smoke test for the agent
# lifecycle control plane (bin/fm-control.sh).
#
# tmux is the control plane's reference backend and is covered hermetically in
# tests/fm-control.test.sh. herdr is the OTHER backend whose recovery-grade
# agent-state classifier the control plane is allowed to trust, so its
# behavior is pinned here against the REAL binary rather than a stub: whether
# an agent is running, and therefore whether a lifecycle verb may act at all,
# comes from herdr's own agent registry.
#
# No real agent is launched. herdr's `pane report-agent` is the same registry
# the adapter reads, so registering and not registering an agent on a plain
# shell pane exercises exactly the classification the control plane gates on.
# A registration over a plain idle shell is the STALE-registration state (the
# registry outliving its agent), which the classifier must downgrade to
# agent-free; modelling a genuinely live agent therefore additionally needs a
# real foreground process in the pane, so the idle-shell cross-check refuses.
#
# Always runs on a private, named, throwaway lab session, never the default
# one (tests/herdr-test-safety.sh; the 2026-07-02 incident). Skips cleanly
# when herdr or jq is missing.
