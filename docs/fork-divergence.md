# Fork divergence ledger

This page is the authoritative ledger of deliberate differences between `HelloWorldSungin/firstmate` and `kunchenguid/firstmate`.
A sync round must preserve every active entry, update an entry when its intent changes, and retire an entry when upstream replaces it.
Task chronology and transient conflict evidence belong in the sync PR rather than this ledger.

## Tracking strategy

The fork follows TRACK, adopted on 2026-08-04.
It periodically takes upstream through full contiguous merges, never through a standing cherry-pick policy and never as a hard fork.
Each round brings one upstream merge through its own reviewable PR, and the configured merge authority lands that PR with a merge commit.
[`sync-upstream`](../.agents/skills/sync-upstream/SKILL.md) owns the round procedure, while [`bin/fm-upstream-status.sh`](../bin/fm-upstream-status.sh) owns drift measurement and the standing trigger verdict.
[`updatefirstmate`](../.agents/skills/updatefirstmate/SKILL.md) remains a separate fast-forward-only update from the fork and never performs an upstream merge.

## Active divergences

### Cursor and Agy crew adapters

The fork carries Cursor Agent CLI and Antigravity CLI adapters so workers can use the operator's paid Composer and Gemini subscriptions.
They are deliberately crew-only and Herdr-only because Herdr supplies the native identity, liveness, working-state, and delivery signals needed to supervise these CLIs without treating screen text as authority.
They are not selectable for the primary firstmate or a persistent second mate, and their raw-command bypasses are rejected so the kind, backend, trust, and supervision guards cannot be skipped.
The adapter contract lives in [`harness-adapters`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md), and its executable guards live in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, `bin/fm-launch-lib.sh`, and their tests.

### Upstream tracking mechanism

This fork carries the optional drift detector, bootstrap diagnostic, sync-round skill and template, and this ledger.
The feature is inert when no `upstream` git remote exists so upstream users do not acquire fork behavior merely by taking another change.
The detector fetches only into a disposable repository and never changes the source repository's objects, refs, index, branch, or worktree.
A sync request dispatches an isolated merge task and PR rather than merging in the primary copy or extending `/updatefirstmate` with merge behavior.

## Retired divergences

### Fork-local remote doctor - retired 2026-08-04

The fork's own 53-line `bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh` design was retired in favor of upstream's remote-second-mate implementation.
Firstmate made that collision decision under the already adopted TRACK strategy after the authorized sync round exposed two independently built versions of the same capability.
Keeping the smaller fork implementation would have selected permanent semantic divergence despite the decision to follow upstream through full merges.
The upstream implementation was also the safer of two not-yet-live paths in this fleet because no registered second mate was using the fork implementation, upstream carried its own broader job-worker and doctor tests, and the fork's compatible `fm-remote-inherit*` additions could survive alongside it.
This is the precedent for future capability collisions: apply TRACK to prefer upstream while preserving compatible fork-only intent, and escalate a genuine contradiction rather than silently blending two designs.

## Parked branches outside the fork baseline

The branches below are deliberately unlanded and are not part of fork `main` or any upstream sync round:

- `fm/fm-afk-injection-wedge`
- `fm/fm-crew-state-blind-during-fix-round`
- `fm/fm-parked-decision-stale-noise`
- `fm/fm-subagent-model-routing-guard`
- `fm/fm-vault-drift-check`

Their presence on a remote is not authorization to merge, rebase onto, resurrect, or cherry-pick from them.
Remove or reclassify an entry only when the branch's underlying decision is resolved through its own work.

## Maintaining the ledger

Keep only current intent and concise safety rationale here.
A sync PR that creates, changes, adopts upstream for, or retires a deliberate divergence updates this page in the same round.
Use full `owner/repo#number` references when a durable rationale needs a PR pointer because fork and upstream numbers occupy separate overlapping spaces.
